# ADR 0012: Workers use stream-json output; usage is parsed from the wire and the worker leads its own process group

**Date:** 2026-05-23
**Status:** Accepted
**Migrated from:** docs/design-decisions.md §8

The worker launches with `claude -p --verbose --output-format stream-json` via `subprocess.Popen(..., stdout=PIPE, stderr=STDOUT, text=True, bufsize=1, start_new_session=True)`, reading output line by line in a reader thread. The per-issue run-log entry gains `model`, a `usage` block (the four token components + `cumulative` + `peak_context`), `cost_usd`, `num_turns`, `session_id`, `is_error`, and an explicit `duration_seconds`; the file gains top-level `cycle_cost_usd` and `cycle_tokens_cumulative`. All of this lives in `drain_cycle/worker.py`; the orchestrator calls `worker.run_issue(...)` and records the result.

**The problem.** A run that burned ~108M tokens left the operator with no on-disk record of *which issue* spent what — usage had to be reconstructed from `~/.claude/projects/*.jsonl`. Spend is the metric the cost guardrail (a downstream slice) acts on, so it has to be captured at the source.

**Why parse the stream rather than the JSONL transcript.** The transcript files are keyed by session and live outside the worktree; correlating them back to an issue after the fact is exactly the manual step this removes. The event stream is emitted by the process we already spawn, in real time, and carries everything we need.

**Token accounting — dedup by `message.id`.** The same `assistant` message is emitted *once per content block* (thinking, text, tool_use), each copy repeating the identical `message.usage`. Summing per event double-counts a turn, so usage is keyed by `message.id` and counted once. `cumulative` sums all four token components across turns — the real billed total, dominated in long tool-use loops by cache reads re-paid every turn (this is what the 108M figure was). `result.usage` is deliberately *not* used for the totals: it is only the final turn's snapshot, and it is absent entirely when a session is killed before finishing. The terminal `result` event is authoritative only for `cost_usd` (`total_cost_usd`), `num_turns`, `session_id`, `is_error`; those are `null` on a killed session.

**Why `start_new_session=True` + `os.killpg`.** The old `subprocess.run(timeout=)` killed only the direct child on timeout, orphaning grandchildren — MCP servers, sub-agents — that kept consuming. Making the worker a process-group leader and SIGKILLing the whole group on the time cap reaps them. SIGKILL with no SIGTERM grace is deliberate: a session past its deadline has no clean-shutdown work worth waiting for, and SIGKILL is the only signal a wedged grandchild cannot ignore. Killing the group also closes the stdout pipe those grandchildren inherited, which is what lets the reader thread reach EOF instead of blocking.

**Additive schema.** `grade.py` reads only `cycle_id` and `entries[].final_linear_state` / `exit_code`, so the new fields don't touch grading and pre-existing run logs grade unchanged. Entries written before any session runs (resolution and setup-failure halts) carry `null` for the worker fields but keep the same key set.

- **Parallelism.** Issues run one at a time. The Linear cycle is the unit; intra-cycle parallelism adds resource contention and serialises poorly with the agent-self-update pattern (two agents racing to mark different issues Done is fine, but two agents racing on overlapping files is not).
- **Retry.** Superseded by ADR 0018 — a halted issue is now resumed automatically on re-run by reusing its preserved worktree, bounded by ``max_resume_attempts``. The operator-owned manual path (inspect, fix, redo, descope) still applies; the change is that the default `drain-cycle` re-run no longer fails on a leftover worktree.
- **Cross-cycle scheduling.** One cycle per invocation. Chaining cycles is an operator concern.
