# ADR 0006: `--dangerously-skip-permissions` is accepted

**Date:** 2026-05-22
**Status:** Accepted
**Migrated from:** docs/design-decisions.md §2

Every spawned session runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. The agent can run any tool on any path inside its worktree, including shell commands, file writes, and network calls, with no operator approval.

**Blast radius.** Bounded to the per-issue worktree under `.worktrees/<issue-identifier>/` inside the target repo, plus the operator's Linear account (the agent can transition issues), plus whatever the spawned shell can reach (env vars, secrets in `~/.config`, network egress). Not bounded to the worktree at the filesystem level — a determined or confused agent can `cd` out.

**Why accepted.** The single-operator personal-product context: target repos are mine, the Linear workspace is mine, the machine is mine. The point of the tool is removing prompts; gating them defeats the purpose. The mitigation is **scope discipline at cycle planning** — don't drain a cycle whose issues touch credentials, production systems, or shared infrastructure. This is operator responsibility, not a tool guarantee.
